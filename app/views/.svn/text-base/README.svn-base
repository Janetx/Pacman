Understanding the RoR views hierarchy
=====================================

RoR renders views something like this (in order from left to right): 
  application.html.erb || [controller].html.erb > [action].html.erb

Example: If we're creating a new user and the path is: http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca:8009/pacman/users/new
  Site root: http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca:8009/pacman
  Controller: users
  Action: new

...even for RESTful paths. Thus RoR will render:
  layouts/application.html.erb

If layouts/application.html.erb does NOT exist...then we render the next best thing: 
  layouts/users.html.erb

Upon encountering the <%= yield > in whichever view was rendered above ... we will go on to render the specific bits: 
  users/new.html.erb

...which will be combined with the layout view to form what you get: (X)HTML code and all. You should be able to output XML as well.
